# Decoding SQL 📊

Welcome to **Decoding SQL**! This repository is a companion to my LinkedIn video series where I tackle SQL interview questions step-by-step, explaining each concept clearly and intuitively. Designed to help you master SQL, the series is split into:

### 1. Joins Simplified 🧩
A mini-series dedicated to demystifying SQL joins, the foundation of complex queries. You'll find breakdowns of joins, and more.

### 2. Interview Questions Explained 🎓
In this main series, we’ll dive into common SQL interview questions, explore different approaches, and go through solutions that are easy to understand and apply.

## Repository Structure 📁

Each day’s content has its own folder, named according to the day or topic covered. Inside each folder, you’ll find:
- **Question** ❓: The SQL question or task covered in the video.
- **Solution** 💡: The SQL query or queries used to solve the question.
